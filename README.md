# Fullcalendar Plugin

The **Fullcalendar** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). It reads an ICS Calendar File and shows Events in a monthly Calendar Widget on your Page(s)

## Installation

Installing the Fullcalendar plugin can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install fullcalendar

This will install the Fullcalendar plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/fullcalendar`.

### Manual Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `fullcalendar`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/wernerjoss/grav-plugin-fullcalendar) or via [GetGrav.org](https://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/fullcalendar
    
> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) and the [Error](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-error) and [Problems](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems) Plugins to operate.

### Admin Plugin

If you use the admin plugin, you can install directly through the admin plugin by browsing the `Plugins` tab and clicking on the `Add` button.

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/fullcalendar/fullcalendar.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/fullcalendar.yaml` and only edit that copy.  
Note that if you use the admin plugin, the file with your configuration, named fullcalendar.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/` folder once the configuration is saved in the admin.  
There is, however, no UI in the admin Backend that provides any customizations other than enable/disable - you will have to edit the config file to do that.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:

```yaml

enabled: true
colors: #3a87ad # see additional Note on custom colors in the Changelog
showlegend: false   # set to true to show calendar File Name(s) as Legend below grid
locale: en  # use your own locale here, e.g. de
weekNumbers: false  # set to true to show Week Numbers
cors_api_url: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/  # this is the default value, change if you like to use another

```

## Usage

Once installed and enabled, you can use this Plugin to parse ICS Calendar File(s) (these must be found in user/data/calendars and set as parameter in Plugin shortcode, without Path !) and display Events from that Calendar(s) anywhere on your Site using this shortcode:

    [fullcalendar icsfile='example0.ics,example1.ics,...'][/fullcalendar]
    
in the appropriate page.  
You can also provide absolute URL's to ICS Files, in which case a CORS proxy will be used to access them.  
As an addition, you can show a Picture for the current month above the calendar widget.  
Just put 12 Image Files named 'January.jpg', 'February.jpg', ... , 'December.jpg' in the Folder for your Page where the Calendar will be placed.
(Note that Image File names must match Month names according to your locale setting, so, for locale: de, use 'Januar.jpg' ...)
